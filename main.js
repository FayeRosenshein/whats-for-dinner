// Intermediate CSS
// Do some research and determine how to make your app respond to the user’s screen size.
// Layout and spacing should adapt to mobile, tablet, desktop and extra large screens.
// Add a loading animation when a user clicks the “Let’s Cook” button to simulate searching for a recipe. Hint - You will need to use CSS Keyframes, and a Javascript timeout function for this.
// Make your buttons grow in size or change color when the user hovers over them, enticing them to click the dang thing.
// When the recipe appears, the text should fade in.
// Remember your user experience and animate these things in gradually. Timing is everything!
